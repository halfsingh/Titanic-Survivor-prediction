# TITANIC SHIPWRECK SURVIVOR PREDICTION

In this project I used data of the Titanic shipwreck and predicted 
a possible list of shipwreck survivors using Decision Trees.

In this repo you'll find- 


Train.csv - the data file I used to train my algorithm

Test.csv - the data I used to make predictions

Titanic - the pynb where all the code is

and
Y_test(TITANIC) - the predictions my algorithm made(Zero means dead and One means alive)
